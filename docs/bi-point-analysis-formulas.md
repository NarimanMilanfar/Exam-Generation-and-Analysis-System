# Bi-Point Analysis Mathematical Formulas

## Point-Biserial Correlation

$$r_{pb} = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)}{s_x} \times \sqrt{\frac{n_1 \times n_2}{n^2}}$$

Where:
- $\bar{X}_1$ = mean score of students who answered correctly
- $\bar{X}_2$ = mean score of students who answered incorrectly  
- $s_x$ = standard deviation of total scores
- $n_1$ = number of students who answered correctly
- $n_2$ = number of students who answered incorrectly
- $n$ = total number of students

## Discrimination Index

$$D = \frac{H - L}{n}$$

Where:
- $H$ = number of high-scoring students who answered correctly
- $L$ = number of low-scoring students who answered correctly
- $n$ = size of high or low group (typically 27% of total)

## Cronbach's Alpha

$$\alpha = \frac{k}{k-1} \left(1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i^2}{\sigma_t^2}\right)$$

Where:
- $k$ = number of items (questions)
- $\sigma_i^2$ = variance of item i
- $\sigma_t^2$ = variance of total scores

## Difficulty Index

$$p = \frac{R}{N}$$

Where:
- $R$ = number of correct responses
- $N$ = total number of responses
